Tip Calculator is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Sanaya Sanghvi
Time spent: 14 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

I included a text field wherein people can directly input the number of people paying the bill, and the application splits up the total bill (including the tip) between the number of people entered and displays the amount each person has to pay.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

It took me a while to get the navigation controller working. Th concept of creating just one push segue from the settings bar button to the settings view controller didnâ€™t work. I realized that the error could be fixed by creating another segue from the first view controller to the second view controller in addition to the settings segue.
